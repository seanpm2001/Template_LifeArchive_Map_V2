# Seans Life Archive map system

A new addition to the life archive system was started on April 7th 2021 after being proposed and planned since April 4th 2021. It is a system of digital maps.

These maps contain coordinates, a virtual recreation of buildings, rooms, and regions, and contain digital resources to recreate the experience of each area.

This map list is for computer labs that I have visited. This list is highly incomplete.
